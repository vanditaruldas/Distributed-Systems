<h2>Simple Messenger on Android</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
In this assignment, you will write a simple messenger app on Android. The goal of this app is simple: enabling two Android devices to send messages to each other. The purpose of this assignment is to help you see if you have the right background for this course. If you can finish this all by yourself without getting any help from others, then it is probably the case that you have the right background. Please see for yourself!

<h3>There are four high-level challenges in this assignment:</h3>
There will be a lot of reading involved in this assignment. This is because you need to read many tutorials/articles online.
There will be a lot of infrastructure setup. This involves installing various software components and configuring them.
There will be many trials and errors to make Android do what you want to do. This is true not just for Android but also for any platform/framework. Luckily, Android provides excellent official documentation. You will need to get used to reading the official developer website.
There are networking restrictions that the Android emulator environment imposes. You need to get used to it for the assignment.
